docker build  #Builds a dockerfile into an image

docker run  #Starts a container from an image

docker-compose up #Starts up a cluster defined by a docker compose file

docker exec  #Executes a command in an already running container

docker-compose run  #I've never actually used this one. Checking the documentation, it seems it runs a new specific container from the docker compose file.

docker-machine  # This is a VM that allows you to run docker on non-linux systems. I think it is losing it's purpose,
				# as Docker for Mac now runs in the OSX hypervisor, maybe its still used for Windows, I'm not sure.

stop all containers:
docker kill $(docker ps -q)

remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

remove all docker images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
