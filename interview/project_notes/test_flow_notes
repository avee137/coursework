gitlab --->	.gitlab-ci.yml ---> scripts/continuous_integration/ci_filter.sh  ----> make dtest-$PIPELINE 
---> lucida-clinc/tests/test.sh ---> uses lucida-clinc/tests/ <>.yml file to run a docker image ----> inside the docker image run a particular test using the make file (eg make test-spotlight)
---> executes the tests using the specified test files using (unittest, manage.py ets , check the label in makefile for details)

***  tests in docker is different from  the previous run using the ( make dtest-spotlight)

1. what happens in make dtest- ??
    ## there is one entry for spotlight . 
    ## should we add one for migrations ??

 ** what is dtest, test, and drmtest ??
    
2. who calls ci_filter.sh ??

.gitlab-ci.yml:66 - this has an entry for spotlight, there should be one for migrations .

3. from where does .gitlab-ci.yml is invoked ??
gitlab would invoke this for any CI being pushed ..


4. test.sh is invoked from makefile using docker run

5. showmigration shows many more tables than those listed in 	clincapi/finie/migrations
   what are those, and where are they ? 
   >> default tables created by django
   
6. where is models.py for each migration generated ?
   >> its in different directories under clincapi/

TODO: 
1. check where makemigration is used in code
>> migrations are done using  `scripts/static_web_setup.sh`

2. where are models ? 

 >>in different files - /lucida-clinc/clincapi/finie/models
 >>may be in other places as well

3. how are migrations generated in our code ? always auto or  can be manually written ??
>> using models.py, not manual

4. how to trigger CI build tests locally, without gitlab ?	

>> make docker-test, but that would not start a runner like gitlab.

>> each pipeline is a label in Makefile eg. 'make dtest-bankutils' runs pipeline 'bankutils' in the 'Test'

5. how to write test cases for migration ?	 

>> https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2016/02/02/writing-unit-tests-django-migrations

6. what exactly is to be tested for any migration ?

7. do we run all migrations or only selected/modified ones?

8. In case any migration file is modifed, do we want to run all the tests like
for example:
 	test-clincapi:
        python clincapi/manage.py test --nomigrations --verbosity=3 --pattern="*_clincapitest.py"

29
9. how to detect if a  migration file is modified ?
>>> similar to spotlight filter

10. where to add pipeline ??   

11. how to run migrations  and fixtures:

Running migrations : scripts/static_web_setup.sh if we setup the appropriate flag, it should run

12. are there any test cases to be written ?
6. what exactly is to be tested for any migration ?

7. do we run all migrations or only selected/modified ones?

13. How to run ci build locally - 
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/312

currently we can add image label in ci yml and start the build process but it fails 
14. do we have custom docker image ??
    >> where is it ?
