migrations : apply new migration on top of existing migrations. 
             apply new migrations on test DB with data in it
             
             
run exiting migrations and fixtures followed by ->
run new migration              
              
LCA_COMMIT=$(git merge-base HEAD FETCH_HEAD) -> gives the commit id of the base from where current repo was branched out

eg this commit - >  for the current branch related with migrations
e96e0c7f454022e0766d3e74c0b91336f487dfe5

how do i get a file from older version ?? 

git show e96e0c7f454022e0766d3e74c0b91336f487dfe5:Makefile
prints the version at the time of the commit !!

this gives list of files in the directory 
git show 3b3a4ca49c808bd9f19b3773efaa830918b39a0b:clincapi/finie/migrations/


can we use 'git checkout master' to move to the base branch ?



#undo git reset - 
git reset 'HEAD@{1}' --> {1} represents reset by 1 count

#large file install
git lfs install

#determine if a dir or parent is a git dir
git rev-parse


# supply args from stdin or from output of one cmd
xargs
eg. find *.json | xargs python2 /usr/local/lucida-clinc/clincapi/manage.py loaddata
supllies the ouput of find to manage.py loaddata


#get a particular version - 

git checkout <commit> <file>

example of the sequence - 

1. move to a particular commit -
 78fef61882a576a65884239d5ef339a66df1b755 scripts/
# everything under script is at version which was at the time of the commit !!

git checkout HEAD scripts/continuous_integration/
# everything under script is back to original !!

TODO :
1. get the LCA
2. checkout the versions of LCA commit - migrations and fixtures
3. apply the all migrations and all fixtures
4. checkout to the original version
5. apply the *new* migrations and all fixtures


>> how to apply a particular migration using Django (skipping other migrations)-

use the --fake option.
Once you revert to 0001 you can run
python manage.py migrate <app> 0002 --fake
and then run
python manage.py migrate <app> #Optionally specify 0003 explicitly
which would apply only 0003 in this case.

ALL THE DJANGO APP SETTINGS ARE HERE- /usr/local/lucida-clinc/clincapi/common/settings - 
base settings - common/settings/base.py


to rollback to a particular migration !
python2 manage.py migrate finie 0048_update_alexa_config

#FINIE IS THE APP NAME


*********************************** 

test cases should be in python using django unittest format or a bash file ??


        #- ./scripts/continuous_integration/ci_filter.sh "$CLONE_SLUG" "$CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME" migrations


*****************
how are docker images built, how to build selectively and restart only that ??
is it running as a docker instance ? 
find out place where db is pushed to a docker image 

TODO:
when running docker-compose second time, how do i pass only new migration files ?
how do i ensure old DB is not wiped ?
