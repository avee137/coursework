test cases:
1. only one migration allowed
2. should not run if no migraion file is changed
3. run if migration file is changed
4. correct fixtures should be applied correctly
5. incorrect fixture should fail
6. 



ISSUES : 

1. existing migrations change during run 


 ** how do i drop the database or all the tables ?? which one of these would work ??
 ** why are tables there on the first run and migration history of django is not populated ??
 ** why did fixture failed with same error locally ??
 
 
 with the news test migrations and fixtures from Eric,
 When running the stack using docker-compose up :
 
 1. the new table is creted - 
finie_finietest

2. new fixture is implemented to it :
mysql> select *from finie_finietest;
+----------------------------------+------+
| id                               | name |
+----------------------------------+------+
| 0f8ba9a3a3454d73b7ff08652d12f0d3 | eric |
+----------------------------------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

3. Upon installing 
   >> old migrations and old fixture 
   >> and new migrations on top of it the new migration fails.
   >> is this the right behavior ??
